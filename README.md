# SNT Pipeline Webapps

This repository contains everything needed to build and deploy **OpenHEXA static webapps**
that let users trigger SNT pipeline runs from a browser — no code required.

The end goal is a single, rich webapp per workspace — the **SNT Pipelines Orchestrator** — that
renders the complete flow diagram of all official SNT pipelines (~20, from the `snt_development`
repo) as an interactive 2D map with a configuration/run sidebar. The small single-pipeline
webapps already in this repo are stepping stones toward it.

Webapps call the OpenHEXA GraphQL API via a same-origin proxy to start pipeline runs and poll
their status. A simple webapp can be a single `index.html`; the orchestrator is a **multi-file
bundle** (`index.html` + `styles.css` + `app.js` + JSON data files) served as-is from the same
origin.

> **Agent-driven repo.** This project is built with Claude Code. The authoritative, detailed
> instructions live in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — the agent reads it at session start. This
> README is the human-facing overview; when the two disagree, `CLAUDE.md` wins.

**Global files** (root + `knowledge/`) apply to all workspaces. **Workspace folders** contain
workspace-specific artifacts. Adding a new workspace means creating a new folder — nothing else
changes.

> **Layout convention.** Each deployed webapp lives in its own snake_case **subfolder** under
> the workspace, matching its key in `deployed_apps` (e.g. `snt_testing/dhis2_reporting_rate/`).
> The older `snt_drc_workshop_demo/` still uses a flat `index.html`; new work follows the
> subfolder convention.

## The data architecture (orchestrator)

The orchestrator separates concerns across four files. The stable join key everywhere is the
node `id` == the pipeline's Python function name (e.g. `snt_dhis2_extract`).

| File                                   | Scope                          | Holds                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pipeline_map.json`                    | **workspace-independent** (root, shared) | all nodes, grid position, type, mutex group, directed `edges` (deps) |
| `<ws>/pipeline_cards.json`             | per-workspace                  | which pipelines exist + `uuid` + `parameters` (drives _active vs greyed_)  |
| `<ws>/workspace_config.json`           | per-workspace                  | IDs, `deployed_apps`, connection slugs                                     |
| `index.html` + `app.js` + `styles.css` | shared app shell (multi-file)  | renders the map, merges with cards, runs/polls pipelines                   |

The **map is identical across all workspaces** — every orchestrator shows the same full diagram.
What differs per workspace is only which nodes are _active_: a node is available iff its `id`
appears in that workspace's `pipeline_cards.json`. Pipelines not present render greyed-out and
unclickable. The map is **hand-authored** (validated against `pipeline_map_schema.json`), not
generated from the API.

---

## How it works

```
pipeline_cards_schema.json        ← schema + instructions for building pipeline catalogs (global)
        ↓ (generated once per workspace)
<workspace>/pipeline_cards.json   ← cached pipeline catalog: names, UUIDs, parameters
        +
<workspace>/workspace_config.json ← deployed_apps IDs, pipeline UUIDs, connection slugs
        +
pipeline_map.json                 ← shared, hand-authored map: layout + dependency edges (orchestrator)
        ↓
<workspace>/<app_key>/            ← bundle deployed to OpenHEXA, mirrored here after every deploy
    index.html + styles.css + app.js + JSON
```

## Using with an AI agent (Claude Code)

Open this directory in Claude Code. The agent reads `CLAUDE.md` for full instructions
automatically. For orchestrator work it also reads `knowledge/PLAN.md` and `knowledge/JIRA_ITEMS.md`
at session start. Then just describe what you want:

- **Deploy to an existing workspace:** "Update the webapp in workspace X to add pipeline Y"
- **Set up a new workspace:** "Create the webapp for workspace Z" — the agent looks up all UUIDs
  via the OpenHEXA MCP tools and creates a new `<workspace>/` folder
- **Add a new pipeline card:** "Add a card for `snt_dhis2_incidence`" — the agent fetches the
  pipeline source from GitHub, extracts the `@parameter` decorators, updates the workspace's
  `pipeline_cards.json`, and redeploys

The agent needs access to the **OpenHEXA MCP server** (configured in Claude Code settings) to
look up workspace/pipeline IDs and deploy webapps.

---

## Adding a new workspace

1. Open Claude Code in this directory
2. Say: _"Create the webapp for workspace `<workspace name>`"_
3. The agent will:
   - Find the workspace slug via `list_workspaces`
   - Resolve pipeline UUIDs via `list_pipelines` and webapp IDs via `list_static_webapps`
   - Create `<workspace>/workspace_config.json` and `<workspace>/pipeline_cards.json`
   - Build and deploy the webapp into `<workspace>/<app_key>/`
4. Commit the new workspace folder

---

## Adding a new pipeline card

1. Tell the agent which workspace to deploy to and which pipelines to include
2. If a pipeline's parameters aren't already cached in `<workspace>/pipeline_cards.json`, the
   agent fetches the source from the
   [snt_development GitHub repo](https://github.com/BLSQ/snt_development) and extracts the
   `@parameter` decorators (see the type mapping and rules in `CLAUDE.md`)
3. The agent rebuilds and redeploys the webapp bundle under `<workspace>/<app_key>/`

> `pipeline_cards.json` is a **cache, not live truth.** Each file carries a `generated_at` date;
> a pipeline's parameters on GitHub can drift after that. Before deploying, the agent states the
> cache date and asks whether to re-fetch params for the pipeline(s) the app will run.

---

## Refreshing the OpenHEXA schema

If `schema.generated.graphql` becomes stale, regenerate it with:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLSQ/openhexa-app/main/frontend/schema.generated.graphql" -OutFile "schema.generated.graphql"
```

## Deployed webapps

| Workspace             | Webapp                          | URL                                                       | Folder                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| SNT DRC Workshop Demo | A.2 DHIS2 Formatting            | https://a-2-dhis2-formatting.openhexa.io/                 | `snt_drc_workshop_demo/`                        |
| SNT Testing           | DHIS2 Reporting Rate            | https://dhis2-reporting-rate.openhexa.io/                 | `snt_testing/dhis2_reporting_rate/`             |
| SNT Testing           | Population Transformation       | https://run-population-transformation-pipeline.openhexa.io/ | `snt_testing/population_transformation/`        |
| SNT Testing           | Population Transformation (split) | https://population-transformation-split.openhexa.io/    | `snt_testing/population_transformation_split/`  |

URLs and IDs come from each workspace's `workspace_config.json` — that file, not this table, is
the source of truth.

> The **SNT Pipelines Orchestrator** will be built and deployed in the dedicated **`snt_app_dev`**
> workspace (all ~18 pipelines installed). It has no deployed webapp yet — a row will be added here
> once the orchestrator bundle ships.
