# Project Context

## Master plan

The plan of action for the SNT Pipelines Orchestrator lives in `knowledge/PLAN.md` (phased,
atomic tasks with owner tags) and its visual roadmap in `knowledge/ROADMAP.md`. **Read
`knowledge/PLAN.md` at the start of any session working toward the orchestrator**, and locate
the task being worked on (e.g. "do T0.9") there before starting.

## OpenHEXA GraphQL Schema

A local copy of the OpenHEXA GraphQL schema is stored in this directory as `schema.generated.graphql`.

**Always read this file at the start of any session involving OpenHEXA static web apps or GraphQL operations.**

To refresh the schema if it becomes stale:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLSQ/openhexa-app/main/frontend/schema.generated.graphql" -OutFile "schema.generated.graphql"
```

## SNT Pipelines Orchestrator (end goal)

The end goal of this project is a single, rich static webapp per workspace — the **SNT
Pipelines Orchestrator** — that renders the *complete* flow diagram of all official SNT
pipelines (~20, from the `snt_development` repo) as an interactive 2D map with a
configuration/run sidebar. The current small single-pipeline webapps are stepping stones
toward it.

The visual and UX target is `examples/orchestration-prototype_2.html`: a scrollable canvas
showing the pipeline map on the left, and a sidebar on the right that — when a node is
selected — shows its description, a generated parameters form, a **Run** button, and (after a
run) the data outputs and HTML report links. Node tags mark each pipeline as mandatory,
alternative, or facultative.

**The map is identical across all workspaces.** Every workspace's orchestrator shows the same
full diagram. What differs per workspace is only which nodes are *active* — pipelines not
available in a given workspace appear greyed-out and unclickable.

### Data architecture

The orchestrator separates concerns across four files. The stable join key everywhere is the
node `id` == the pipeline's Python function name (e.g. `snt_dhis2_extract`).

| File | Scope | Holds |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| `pipeline_map.json` | **workspace-independent** (repo root, one shared file) | all nodes, grid position (`row`/`col`), `type`, mutex `group`, directed `edges` (dependencies) |
| `<ws>/pipeline_cards.json` | per-workspace | which pipelines exist + `uuid` + `parameters` (drives *active vs greyed*) |
| `<ws>/workspace_config.json` | per-workspace | IDs, `deployed_apps`, connection slugs |
| `index.html` + `app.js` + `styles.css` | shared app shell (multi-file) | renders the map, merges it with the workspace cards, runs/polls pipelines |

`pipeline_map_schema.json` (repo root) documents the structure of `pipeline_map.json` — read
it when authoring or interpreting the map. The map is **hand-authored** (a separate task); it
is not generated from the GraphQL API.

### Node states

The webapp computes three independent state axes per node:

- **available vs greyed** — *static*: a node is available iff its `id` is present in the
  workspace's `pipeline_cards.json` (with a `uuid`). Otherwise it renders greyed-out and is
  unclickable. This is how the same full map adapts to each workspace.
- **locked vs unlocked** — *dynamic*: derived from `edges`. A node unlocks once every upstream
  prerequisite (each edge whose `to` equals this node) has a completed run in the current
  session.
- **completed** — ran successfully in the current session.

**Mutual exclusion:** nodes of `type: "alternative"` that share the same `group` are mutually
exclusive — running one marks the others in the group not-run (mirrors the prototype's A.3.x /
A.4.x logic, but data-driven via `group` instead of hardcoded `if` statements).

### Map format

Positions and arrows are **explicit**, with no graph-layout library or CDN dependency:

- Each node carries an explicit `row` (execution stage, top→bottom) and `col` (horizontal
  position, used to separate parallel A / B / D tracks).
- `edges` is a list of `{from, to}` pairs referencing node `id`s; the webapp draws one SVG
  arrow per edge between node centers.
- Dependencies are expressed **only** as `edges` — this replaces the prototype's per-node
  `req` array, its `rows` layout array, and its hardcoded mutual-exclusion `if` statements.
- **Outputs are not stored in the map or cards.** They are fetched at runtime from
  `pipelineRun.outputs` after a run (see the polling pattern below). The prototype's hardcoded
  `outputs` arrays were mock data only.

### Multi-file app architecture

OpenHEXA static webapps serve more than just `index.html`. Per the OpenHEXA docs:

> *"`index.html` is the entry point; everything else (CSS, JS, images, JSON fixtures) is
> served as-is from the same origin... Reference assets with relative paths
> (`<script src="app.js">`, `<link href="style.css">`). The injection only touches `text/html`
> responses; CSS, JS, and JSON files are untouched."*

So the orchestrator is a **multi-file bundle**, not one giant file:

- `index.html` — minimal shell (canvas + sidebar containers, `<link>` to CSS, `<script>` to JS)
- `styles.css` — all styling (cards, node states, sidebar, SVG arrows)
- `app.js` — render the grid + SVG edges, merge map with cards, run + poll pipelines
- `pipeline_map.json` — the shared map (deployed alongside the app), fetched at runtime
- `pipeline_cards.json` — the workspace's card catalog (deployed alongside the app), fetched
  at runtime

`app.js` loads the two JSON files with same-origin `fetch("./pipeline_map.json")` etc. All the
shared runtime patterns below (the `gql` helper, status polling, `prepareObjectDownload`,
prefixed element handling) still apply — they just live in `app.js` rather than inline.

### Build / deploy workflow

- Deploy via `mcp__claude_ai_OpenHEXA__update_static_webapp` with `files_json` as the
  multi-file array: one `{path, content}` object per file in the bundle above.
- `allowed_operations`: at minimum `PIPELINES_READ, PIPELINES_RUN, FILES_READ`. Add
  `USER_READ` if the app queries workspace connections at runtime (to populate
  `DHIS2Connection` dropdowns).
- After every deploy, mirror **all** deployed files locally under `<ws>/<app_key>/` (not just
  `index.html`), so the local copy stays in sync.

## OpenHEXA Static Webapp Runtime Patterns

These patterns apply to any static webapp deployed on OpenHEXA. They are non-obvious and must not be guessed from the schema alone.

### Platform-injected global

The platform injects this global at page load — the only reliable way to get the workspace slug at runtime:

```js
window.OPENHEXA.workspaceSlug;
```

### GraphQL proxy

All API calls go to the same-origin relative URL `/graphql/`. No auth token is needed; authentication is handled via session cookie:

```js
fetch("/graphql/", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables }),
});
```

### `allowed_operations` scopes

The proxy enforces a whitelist of permitted GraphQL operations. Set via `update_static_webapp` MCP tool's `allowed_operations` parameter (comma-separated). Valid values:

`PIPELINES_READ`, `PIPELINES_RUN`, `FILES_READ`, `FILES_WRITE`, `DATASETS_READ`, `DATASETS_WRITE`, `USER_READ`

If a query fails with a permission error in the webapp, a scope is missing. The SNT pipeline webapp requires at minimum `PIPELINES_READ, PIPELINES_RUN, FILES_READ`.

### Running a pipeline

Pass the pipeline **UUID** (not code/slug) as `id`. Parameters go in `config` as a plain JSON object with keys matching the pipeline's parameter names exactly:

```graphql
mutation ($input: RunPipelineInput!) {
  runPipeline(input: $input) {
    success
    errors
    run {
      id
      status
    }
  }
}
```

For parameters of type `DHIS2Connection`, pass the **connection slug** (e.g. `"dhis2-nmdr-drc"`), not the UUID. List available connections with `mcp__claude_ai_OpenHEXA__list_connections`.

### Polling a run for status and outputs

```graphql
query ($id: UUID!) {
  pipelineRun(id: $id) {
    status
    duration
    outputs {
      __typename
      ... on BucketObject {
        key
        name
      }
      ... on GenericOutput {
        uri
      }
    }
    datasetVersions {
      id
      dataset {
        slug
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`outputs` is a union type — always use `__typename` inline fragments. Terminal statuses: `success`, `failed`, `stopped`, `terminating`.

### Getting a signed download URL for a bucket output (e.g. HTML report)

Requires `FILES_READ` scope:

```graphql
mutation ($input: PrepareObjectDownloadInput!) {
  prepareObjectDownload(input: $input) {
    success
    downloadUrl
  }
}
```

Input fields: `workspaceSlug`, `objectKey` (from the BucketObject), `forceAttachment: false`.

### Constructing the app.openhexa.io dataset URL

```js
var appBase =
  "https://app." + window.location.hostname.split(".").slice(1).join(".");
// e.g. window.location.hostname = "a-2-dhis2-formatting.openhexa.io"
// → appBase = "https://app.openhexa.io"
var datasetUrl =
  appBase + "/workspaces/" + workspaceSlug + "/datasets/" + datasetSlug + "/";
```

### Multi-card pattern (multiple pipelines on one page)

When a single webapp hosts cards for multiple pipelines:

- Prefix all element IDs with the card key (e.g. `a1_statusBox`, `a2_runBtn`)
- Store per-pipeline config (UUID, `getConfig` fn, `validate` fn) in a `PIPELINE_CONFIG` object keyed by prefix
- All shared functions (`gql`, `setStatus`, `showOutputs`, etc.) accept `prefix` as their first argument
- Cards run completely independently — triggering one does not affect the other's state

### MCP deployment

Use `mcp__claude_ai_OpenHEXA__update_static_webapp` with `files_json` as a JSON array of `{path, content}` objects to deploy. On `update_static_webapp` the `name`/`description` fields are silently ignored by the server (rename webapps from the OpenHEXA UI instead); `create_static_webapp` **does** honor `name`.

### Assembling `files_json` on Windows (PowerShell 5.1)

Splitting an app into html+css+js just means a longer `files_json` array — OpenHEXA serves the
bundle as documented (relative `<link>`/`<script>` resolve same-origin; only `index.html` is
HTML-injected). The friction is building the JSON on Windows, not the deploy:

- **Read as UTF-8 explicitly** — `Get-Content -Raw` defaults to ANSI and mangles non-ASCII
  (`—`, emoji `📄🗂`, glyphs `✓✕⦸`) into mojibake. Use `Get-Content -Raw -Encoding UTF8`.
- **Cast content to `[string]` before `ConvertTo-Json`** — otherwise the property serializes as
  `{value, Count}` and balloons (~50×: a 20 KB bundle became 1.17 MB).
- **`ConvertTo-Json` emits `<` `>` `&` `'` as escaped unicode sequences (`\uXXXX`), not
  literal characters** — valid JSON, OpenHEXA parses and serves it fine. Don't "fix" it.

Recipe: `@($files | % { [PSCustomObject]@{ path=$_; content=[string](Get-Content -Raw -Encoding UTF8 $_) } }) | ConvertTo-Json -Compress`

### Pipeline IDs are workspace-specific

Pipeline **UUIDs** and **codes/slugs** both differ across workspaces for the same pipeline. The only stable identifier is the **Python function name** (e.g. `snt_dhis2_extract`) — this is used as the key in both `pipeline_cards_schema.json` and `workspace_config.json`. When building a new `workspace_config.json`, find the matching pipeline by searching `list_pipelines` results by display name (e.g. "A.1 DHIS2 Extract") — do not rely on the code/slug matching. Never copy UUIDs from another workspace's config.

---

## SNT Pipeline Definitions

`pipeline_cards_schema.json` (repo root) documents the expected structure for workspace-specific `pipeline_cards.json` files — field definitions, type mapping, and generation instructions. Read it when generating or interpreting pipeline data.

Each workspace folder contains a `pipeline_cards.json` — a cached catalog of every pipeline available in that workspace, with display names, UUIDs, and full parameter definitions fetched from GitHub.

**At session start, check whether `<workspace>/pipeline_cards.json` exists:**

- **If yes** — use it as the pipeline catalog. No need to call `list_pipelines` or fetch GitHub sources.
- **If no** — generate it following the `_generation_instructions` in `pipeline_cards_schema.json`, save it to `<workspace>/pipeline_cards.json`, then proceed.

`pipeline_cards.json` is the primary source for: which pipelines exist in the workspace (with UUIDs) and what parameters each pipeline accepts (for building UI cards).

**It is a cache, not live truth — confirm before deploy.** Each file carries a `generated_at`
date; a pipeline's `@parameter` decorators on GitHub can change after that (a renamed/added/
removed param makes runs fail with `The provided config contains invalid key(s): …`). So
before building or deploying any webapp, state the cards' `generated_at` date and ask the user
whether to re-fetch params for **only the pipeline(s) that app will run** (not the whole
catalog) from `…/snt_development/main/{pipeline_id}/pipeline.py`. If they confirm, re-extract
the decorators, patch any drift into both `pipeline_cards.json` (bump `generated_at`) and the
app's `PIPELINE_CONFIG`/form, then deploy.

### How to add or update a pipeline definition

The user will specify which pipelines to include. For each one, fetch its source code from GitHub and extract the parameter definitions directly from the `@parameter` decorators.

**GitHub repository:** `https://github.com/BLSQ/snt_development`

**Finding the pipeline source file:** each pipeline lives in a folder at the repo root named after its Python function name (`{pipeline_id}/pipeline.py`). Fetch the raw file via:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLSQ/snt_development/main/{pipeline_id}/pipeline.py
```

Example for `snt_dhis2_extract`:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLSQ/snt_development/main/snt_dhis2_extract/pipeline.py
```

Do **not** look inside a `pipelines/` folder — it does not contain the correct source files.

**Extracting parameters:** parameters are declared as `@parameter` decorators stacked above the pipeline function. Read them **top to bottom** — that order is the display order in the UI. Each decorator maps to one entry in the `parameters` array:

```python
@parameter(
    "param_key",            # → "key"
    name="Display Label",   # → "label"
    help="Help text",       # → "help"
    type=bool,              # → "type"  (see mapping below)
    default=True,           # → "default"  (omit if None)
    required=False,         # → "required"  (omit if False)
    choices=["a", "b"],     # → "choices"  (omit if absent)
)
```

**Type mapping:**

| Python type in decorator | JSON `type` value    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `bool`                   | `"bool"`             |
| `int`                    | `"int"`              |
| `float`                  | `"float"`            |
| `str`                    | `"str"`              |
| `DHIS2Connection`        | `"DHIS2Connection"`  |
| `CustomConnection`       | `"CustomConnection"` |
| `File`                   | `"File"`             |

**Rules:**

- Omit `default` if its value is `None`.
- Omit `required` if it is `False` — absence means optional.
- If `choices` is a list of tuples `(value, label)`, keep only the value (first element).
- The card `name` (display title) and `description` (subtitle) are **not** in the Python source. Get the display name from `list_pipelines` in OpenHEXA or ask the user. Do not invent them.
- The `id` field is the Python function name — the first argument to `@pipeline(...)`, which is also the folder name in the repo and the key in `workspace_config.json`.

---

## Workspace-Specific Configuration

Each workspace has its own folder in this repo, named after the workspace slug with hyphens replaced by underscores (e.g. `snt_testing/`, `snt_drc_workshop_demo/`). Every workspace folder contains:

- **`workspace_config.json`** — resolved IDs for that workspace (pipeline UUIDs, webapp IDs under `deployed_apps`, connection slugs). Looked up via MCP tools. Never copy these IDs from another workspace's folder.
- **One subfolder per deployed webapp**, mirroring every file as it was last deployed to OpenHEXA. A simple single-pipeline webapp is a single `index.html`; the SNT Pipelines Orchestrator is a multi-file bundle (`index.html` + `styles.css` + `app.js` + `pipeline_map.json` + `pipeline_cards.json` — see the multi-file app architecture above). The subfolder name is a short, descriptive snake_case identifier that matches the corresponding key in `deployed_apps` (e.g. `dhis2_reporting_rate/index.html`, `population_transformation/index.html`).

**There is no MCP tool to read or download existing webapp code from OpenHEXA.** The only available tools are for creating or updating webapps. This means:

- The local `<workspace>/<app_key>/index.html` is the sole source of truth the agent can read. Always read it before making any changes.
- If tasked with updating an existing webapp, the user must manually download the current version from OpenHEXA and save it as `<workspace>/<app_key>/index.html` before the session. If no local file exists, the agent must build from scratch.
- Never assume the live webapp on OpenHEXA matches the local file — only the user can verify this by checking the deployed URL.
- After every deploy, always write the deployed file(s) to `<workspace>/<app_key>/` so the local copy stays in sync — `index.html` for a single-file webapp, or the full bundle for a multi-file one.

### How to build or update the webapp for a workspace

The agent's job is to produce the correct `<workspace>/<app_key>/index.html` for a given webapp and deploy it. The two source files are:

- **`pipeline_cards_schema.json`** (repo root) — canonical pipeline definitions: which parameters to expose, their types, defaults, and help text. Read this to know what UI to build.
- **`<workspace>/workspace_config.json`** — workspace-specific UUIDs to embed in the JavaScript (`PIPELINE_CONFIG` object). Read this to get the correct `id` values for each pipeline card.

When building or updating `<workspace>/<app_key>/index.html`:

1. Use `pipeline_cards_schema.json` to determine the parameters and card layout for each pipeline.
2. Use `<workspace>/workspace_config.json` to fill in the pipeline UUIDs in the `PIPELINE_CONFIG` JS object.
3. Follow the runtime patterns above (prefixed IDs, shared functions, `allowed_operations`, etc.).
4. Deploy via `mcp__claude_ai_OpenHEXA__update_static_webapp` using `deployed_apps.<app_key>.id` from the workspace config.
5. Write the deployed file(s) to `<workspace>/<app_key>/`.

> For the **SNT Pipelines Orchestrator** specifically, follow the multi-file architecture in
> *SNT Pipelines Orchestrator (end goal)* above: the map (`pipeline_map.json`, validated
> against `pipeline_map_schema.json`) supplies layout and dependencies, the workspace's
> `pipeline_cards.json` supplies which nodes are active plus their params/UUIDs, and the app
> is deployed as a bundle rather than a single inlined `index.html`.

### Session start workflow

**At the start of any session involving deployment or pipeline operations, always ask the user which OpenHEXA workspace they want to work on before doing anything else.**

Then:

1. Check whether a folder for that workspace already exists (e.g. `snt_testing/`).
2. If yes — read `<workspace>/workspace_config.json` and use the IDs it contains.
3. If no — use `mcp__claude_ai_OpenHEXA__list_workspaces` to find the workspace slug, then `mcp__claude_ai_OpenHEXA__list_pipelines` and `mcp__claude_ai_OpenHEXA__list_static_webapps` to resolve all UUIDs, then create the workspace folder and write `workspace_config.json` before proceeding.

Keys used in `workspace_config.json`:

- `workspace_slug` — used in all MCP tool calls
- `deployed_apps` — keyed by a short snake_case app identifier that also names the local subfolder (e.g. `dhis2_reporting_rate`, `population_transformation`). Each value has `id` (passed to `update_static_webapp`), `slug`, and `url`.
- `pipelines` — keyed by Python function name, value is the UUID passed to `runPipeline`
- `connections` — keyed by type (e.g. `"dhis2"`), value is the connection slug passed as a `DHIS2Connection` parameter
